# DS Registry

The DS Registry is a single JSON file (`.claude/ds-registry.json`) that combines component metadata, Storybook stories, Figma mappings, and token data into one file every skill can read.

**Time estimate:** 15 minutes to set up generation, then fully automatic.

---

## Why a Registry?

Each skill (`/ds-sync`, `/ds-report`, `/ds-proto`) reads multiple files to build context:

1. **Barrel export** (`src/main.tsx`) to discover components
2. **Each component source file** to extract CVA variants, props, tokens, Radix primitives
3. **Each story file** to find Storybook story names and argTypes
4. **Figma mapping file** (`.claude/ds-story-figma-map.json`) to look up Figma node IDs
5. **Token map** (`.claude/ds-token-map.json`) to cross-reference CSS tokens with Figma variables
6. **Design system manifest** (`design-system-manifest.json`) for icon inventory

For a design system with 50+ components, this means **~85 file operations** per skill invocation — barrel reads, source file reads, story file globs and reads, JSON loads. Each of these is a tool call with latency overhead.

The registry collapses all of that into **one file read**: ~3,100 lines for a typical DS, loaded in a single `Read` operation.

### Before vs After

| Metric | Without Registry | With Registry |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| File reads per skill run | ~85 | 1 |
| Tool calls for context loading | ~15-25 | 1 |
| Time to load DS context | 30-60 seconds | 2-3 seconds |
| Stale data risk | High (reads live files) | Low (regenerated on Storybook start) |

## Schema

The registry JSON has five top-level sections:

```json
{
  "_meta": { ... },
  "components": { ... },
  "tokens": { ... },
  "icons": { ... },
  "sections": [ ... ],
  "outliers": { ... }
}
```

### `_meta`

Generation metadata and global identifiers.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | `string` | Schema version (`"1.0.0"`) |
| `generatedAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `generatedBy` | `string` | Script that generated the file |
| `figmaFile` | `string?` | Figma file key (from mapping file) |
| `tokenStats` | `object?` | `{ primitives: number, semantic: number }` |

### `components`

A flat object keyed by PascalCase component name. Each entry:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Component name (matches the key) |
| `package` | `string` | Package name (e.g., `@acme/ds`) |
| `sourceFile` | `string` | Relative path to the component source file |
| `section` | `string` | Storybook/Figma section (e.g., `"Actions"`, `"Forms"`) |
| `variants` | `Record<string, string[]>?` | CVA variant keys and their options |
| `defaultVariants` | `Record<string, string>?` | CVA default variant values |
| `props` | `Record<string, string>?` | Interface props (name to TypeScript type) |
| `tokens` | `string[]?` | Semantic tokens referenced in component source |
| `radixPrimitives` | `string[]?` | Radix UI primitives used (e.g., `["slot", "dialog"]`) |
| `stories` | `object?` | `{ file, path, variants, argTypes? }` |
| `figma` | `object?` | `{ nodeId, type, variantCount?, sectionFrameId? }` |

### `tokens`

Token cross-reference data (only present if a token map file exists).

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `primitives` | `Record<string, { hex, figmaVarId, figmaName }>` | Primitive colour tokens |
| `semantic` | `Record<string, { figmaVarId, figmaName, darkAlias?, lightAlias? }>` | Semantic tokens with mode aliases |

### `icons`

Icon inventory (only present if a manifest with icons exists).

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `custom` | `string[]` | Custom icon component names |
| `remix` | `string[]` | Remix Icon component names used |

### `sections`

Sorted array of all section names found across components (e.g., `["Actions", "Data Display", "Forms", "Layout"]`).

### `outliers`

Components that exist in only one pillar (Storybook-only or Figma-only), pulled from the mapping file.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `storybookOnly` | `Record<string, string[]>` | Section name to array of component names |
| `figmaOnly` | `Record<string, string>` | Component name to description/note |

## Example Entry

Here is a genericised example of a Button component in the registry:

```json
{
  "Button": {
    "name": "Button",
    "package": "@acme/ds",
    "sourceFile": "packages/ds/src/components/button/button.tsx",
    "section": "Actions",
    "variants": {
      "intent": ["primary", "secondary", "positive", "negative"],
      "size": ["small", "medium", "large"]
    },
    "defaultVariants": { "size": "small" },
    "props": {
      "icon": "ReactNode",
      "loading": "boolean",
      "asChild": "boolean"
    },
    "tokens": ["primary-foreground", "surface-background", "blue-bay"],
    "radixPrimitives": ["slot"],
    "stories": {
      "file": "packages/ds/stories/button.stories.tsx",
      "path": "Components/Actions/Button",
      "variants": ["Primary", "Secondary", "Loading", "Disabled"]
    },
    "figma": {
      "nodeId": "5321:90928",
      "type": "COMPONENT_SET",
      "variantCount": 48,
      "sectionFrameId": "5321:90953"
    }
  }
}
```

## Generating the Registry

The registry is generated by a TypeScript script that reads your source files and produces `.claude/ds-registry.json`.

### 1. Install the Script

Copy `scripts/generate-ds-registry.ts` into your project's `scripts/` directory. See [the template script](../scripts/generate-ds-registry.ts) for the full implementation.

### 2. Configure Paths

Edit the constants at the top of the script to match your project structure:

```typescript
// Component source directories
const DS_SRC = join(ROOT, "packages/ds/src");

// Story file directories
const STORIES_DIRS = [
  join(ROOT, "packages/ds/stories"),
];

// Optional data files
const FIGMA_MAP_PATH = join(ROOT, ".claude/ds-story-figma-map.json");
const TOKEN_MAP_PATH = join(ROOT, ".claude/ds-token-map.json");

// Output
const OUTPUT_PATH = join(ROOT, ".claude/ds-registry.json");
```

### 3. Add an npm Script

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ds:registry": "npx tsx scripts/generate-ds-registry.ts"
  }
}
```

### 4. Run It

```bash
pnpm ds:registry
```

Output:

```
ds-registry.json generated:
  52 components across 8 sections
  340 tokens mapped
  12 custom icons, 87 remix icons
  Output: .claude/ds-registry.json
```

---

## Auto-Sync with Storybook

The registry should always be fresh when Storybook starts. Add a `prestorybook` hook to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ds:registry": "npx tsx scripts/generate-ds-registry.ts",
    "prestorybook": "pnpm ds:registry",
    "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006"
  }
}
```

Now every time you (or any skill) starts Storybook, the registry is regenerated first. This guarantees the data is never stale.

You can also add it to CI if you want to validate the registry is committed and up to date:

```bash
pnpm ds:registry
git diff --exit-code .claude/ds-registry.json || echo "Registry out of date"
```

---

## How Skills Use the Registry

Each skill checks for the registry as its first action in context loading:

```
If `.claude/ds-registry.json` exists:
  Read it as the primary data source (single file read).
  Skip individual file discovery (barrel exports, story globs, Figma map, token map).
Otherwise:
  Fall back to reading individual files.
```

### `/ds-report` (Parity Report)

The registry provides the complete component inventory, story metadata, and Figma mapping in one read. Phase 1 (Collect Inventories) shrinks from ~40 file reads to 1 registry read + 1 Figma API call.

### `/ds-sync` (Storybook-to-Figma Sync)

Phase 1 loads the token map, component metadata, and Figma node IDs from the registry instead of reading the barrel export, each component source, the mapping file, and the token CSS files separately.

### `/ds-proto` (Prototyper)

Phase 1 loads the full component inventory (names, variants, props, tokens, stories) from the registry. The prototyper gets the same data it would from reading the manifest + barrel + story files, but in a single operation.

## What the Script Reads

The generation script reads these source files and merges them:

| Source | What It Extracts |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Barrel export** (`main.tsx`) | Component names and source file paths |
| **Component source files** (`.tsx`) | CVA variants, default variants, interface props, Tailwind token references, Radix primitives |
| **Story files** (`.stories.tsx`) | Story title, section, exported story names, argTypes |
| **Figma mapping** (`.claude/ds-story-figma-map.json`) | Figma node IDs, types, variant counts, section frame IDs |
| **Token map** (`.claude/ds-token-map.json`) | Primitive and semantic token cross-references |
| **Manifest** (`design-system-manifest.json`) | Icon inventory |

All sources except the barrel export and component files are optional. If a file is missing, the script omits that section from the registry.

---

## Keeping the Registry in Sync

The registry is a **generated artifact**. To keep it accurate:

1. **Regenerate after adding/removing components** — run `pnpm ds:registry`
2. **Regenerate after modifying CVA variants** — variant changes in source files are only picked up on regeneration
3. **Regenerate after updating the Figma mapping** — new Figma node IDs need to flow into the registry
4. **Commit the registry** — it should be checked into version control so that CI and other developers have it available without running the script
5. **Use the `prestorybook` hook** — this is the easiest way to ensure freshness during development

---

## Troubleshooting

### Registry is empty or missing components

- Check that your barrel export path is correct in the script
- Verify that components use `export const` or `export function` patterns
- Check the console output for the component count

### CVA variants not detected

- The parser uses brace-counting to find the `variants: { ... }` block in CVA calls
- Make sure your `variants:` key is at the top level of the CVA config (not nested inside another function)
- Single-line variant definitions (`key: "value",`) and multi-line definitions are both supported

### Stories not linked to components

- The script matches stories to components by comparing the last segment of the Storybook `title` to the component name
- Example: title `"Components/Actions/Button"` matches component `Button`
- If your naming convention differs, update the matching logic in `parseStoryFiles()`

### Figma data missing

- Verify `.claude/ds-story-figma-map.json` exists and has the correct structure
- Component names in the Figma map must match the barrel export names exactly (PascalCase)
